# Commit Log

## Commit 1: feat: Add DiagnosisAgent placeholder
- Created `src/agents/developer/diagnosis_agent.py`.

## Commit 4: feat: Integrate core components in OrchestrationEngine
- Updated `src/core/orchestration_engine.py` to integrate `TaskStateManager`, `LoadBalancer`, `DiagnosisAgent`, `OllamaEngine`, and `OpenAI Engine`.
- Modified `process_request` to simulate routing and component interaction.


## Commit 5: feat: Implement OrchestrationEngine LLM interaction and task state updates
- Enhanced `OrchestrationEngine.process_request` to make actual calls to LLM engines and update task states.


## Commit 6: fix: Correct OrchestrationEngine syntax errors and global variable access
- Addressed Pylance errors in `OrchestrationEngine.process_request` and example usage block.
- Corrected global variable access within `process_request`.


## Commit 7: feat: Implement /api/v1/metrics endpoint
- Implemented the `/api/v1/metrics` endpoint in `src/core/api_handler.py` with simulated metrics.


## Commit 8: feat: Integrate basic feedback loop logic in Orchestration Engine
- Implemented a simulated feedback loop in `_handle_plan_mode`.
- Added placeholder `QAAgent` and `DebugAgent` for simulation.
- Modified `_load_agents` to include the new agents.

## Commit 9: feat: Implement full RESTful API endpoint for task creation
- Integrated `api_handler.py` with `OrchestrationEngine`.
- The `create_task` endpoint now calls `process_request` and returns a real task ID and status.
- Removed simulated logic from the endpoint.

## Commit 10: docs: Update commit_log.md
- Updated `commit_log.md` with the latest commits.

## Commit 11: chore: Move commit_log.md to docs/ and update gitignore
- Moved `commit_log.md` to `docs/` and updated `.gitignore` to ignore `/plan` and `/plan/logs`.

## Commit 12: refactor: Update commit log reference to docs/commit_log.md
- Updated the reference to `commit_log.md` within the file itself.

## Commit 13: fix: Correct OrchestrationEngine syntax errors and global variable access
- Addressed Pylance errors in `OrchestrationEngine.py` related to indentation, statement separation, and global variable access.

## Commit 14: feat: Implement /api/v1/metrics endpoint
- Implemented the `/api/v1/metrics` endpoint in `src/core/api_handler.py` with simulated metrics.

## Commit 15: docs: Update commit_log.md
- Updated `commit_log.md` with the latest commits.

## Commit 16: feat: Add setter methods to OrchestrationEngine and correct component assignment
- Added setter methods to `OrchestrationEngine` for `task_state_manager` and `load_balancer`.
- Corrected component assignment in `initialize_core_components`.
