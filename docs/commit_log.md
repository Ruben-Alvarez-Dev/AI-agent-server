- Modified `process_request` to simulate routing and component interaction.


## Commit 5: feat: Implement OrchestrationEngine LLM interaction and task state updates
- Enhanced `OrchestrationEngine.process_request` to make actual calls to LLM engines and update task states.


## Commit 6: fix: Correct OrchestrationEngine syntax errors and global variable access
- Addressed Pylance errors in `OrchestrationEngine.process_request` and example usage block.
- Corrected global variable access within `process_request`.


## Commit 7: feat: Implement /api/v1/metrics endpoint
- Implemented the `/api/v1/metrics` endpoint in `src/core/api_handler.py` with simulated metrics.


## Commit 8: feat: Integrate basic feedback loop logic in Orchestration Engine
- Implemented a simulated feedback loop in `_handle_plan_mode`.
- Added placeholder `QAAgent` and `DebugAgent` for simulation.
- Modified `_load_agents` to include the new agents.

## Commit 9: feat: Implement full RESTful API endpoint for task creation
- Integrated `api_handler.py` with `OrchestrationEngine`.
- The `create_task` endpoint now calls `process_request` and returns a real task ID and status.
- Removed simulated logic from the endpoint.

## Commit 10: docs: Update commit_log.md
- Updated `commit_log.md` with the latest commits.

## Commit 11: chore: Move commit_log.md to docs/ and update gitignore
